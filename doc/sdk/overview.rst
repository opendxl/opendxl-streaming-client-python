Overview
========

The OpenDXL Streaming Python client library is used to consume records
from a
`Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_
(DXL) Streaming Service.

The DXL Streaming Service exposes a REST-based API that communicates
with a back-end streaming platform (Kafka, Kinesis, etc.). The streaming service
performs authentication and authorization and exposes methods to retrieve
records.

One concrete example of a DXL Streaming Service is the
`McAfee Investigator <https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/investigator.html>`_
"Events feed".
